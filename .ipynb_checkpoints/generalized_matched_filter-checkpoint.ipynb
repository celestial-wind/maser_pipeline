    "# Generalized Matched Filter Analysis for CHIME OH Megamaser Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In radio astronomy, optimal signal detection in the presence of correlated noise requires careful consideration of the noise covariance structure. For CHIME telescope observations targeting OH megamasers, the standard approach of applying a delay filter (polynomial fitting) to remove foreground contamination introduces frequency-dependent correlations in the residual noise. This analysis quantifies the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement achievable by implementing a generalized matched filter (GMF) that accounts for the full noise covariance matrix, compared to a simple matched filter (SMF) that assumes uncorrelated Gaussian noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Significant correlation structure** exists in delay-filtered CHIME data, with ~40% of frequency modes contributing to 90% of the noise variance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvalue truncation** to ~850 modes eliminates numerical instability while preserving the physical correlation structure\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Signal-dependent gains** vary from 2.1× (broadband) to 3.2× (narrow lines), making GMF particularly valuable for weak source detection\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computational cost** is manageable with modern hardware, requiring only eigenspace projection operations during detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2-4× SNR improvement represents a substantial gain for astronomical surveys, potentially enabling detection of OH megamasers that would otherwise remain below the noise threshold with conventional processing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use eigenvalue truncation** at N_eff ≈ 850 modes to maintain numerical stability\n",
    "2. **Optimize for narrow line signals** if targeting specific OH transitions  \n",
    "3. **Validate covariance estimation** using spatial or temporal jackknife resampling\n",
    "4. **Monitor condition number** to detect changes in instrument or RFI environment\n",
